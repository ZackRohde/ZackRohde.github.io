            <h2>2012 - 2014</h2>
            <p>I graduated from high school and enlisted into the Marine Corps. I waited 7 months for an infantry
              contract before I left for boot camp Jan 2013. I was stationed at Camp Pendleton for my entire enlistment.
              I deployed my first time in 2013-2014 on a 6 month deployment to Austrailia were we trained with the
              Australian Army and New Zeland Army creating rapport and setting up what is now a very large forwarding
              operating base. </p>

            <p>My 2nd deployment came in 2015-2016 where we were on the 31st MEU (Marine Expedtionary
              Unit) and I was assigned the role squad leader where I had around 10 Marines under my watch. We sailed the
              North Pacfic Ocean visting South Korea, Japan, Okiniawa, and Thailand. </p>

              <h2>2016 - 2017</h2>
              <p>Once it became closer to me getting out around the end of 2016, I had the opportunity to join PMO
                (Provost Marshall's Office, also known as Military Police) where I would stay over 6 months. I quickly
                excelled and went from gate guard to working on the streets responding to 911 calls. As my time
                came to an end I looked forward
                to what the civilian world had to offer and March 14th, 2017 I offically became a veteran of the Marine
                Corps. </p>

              <h2>2017</h2>
              <p> Fresh out of the military I start my civilian journey. Fitness has always been a passion of mine as I
                believe health and fitness is the way to live a successful life. I joined 24 hour fitness as a personal
                trainer in Oceanside, CA where I had many clients who were either looking to gain weight and strength or
                other clients
                looking to lose a few pounds. I stayed on this adventure for around 6 months until I started realizing
                peoeple will only help themselves if they truly want a better life and sad to say majority of the time
                they took the easy way out. I knew health and fitness was for me, but personal
                training was not at that time. </p>

              <h2>2017 - 2020</h2>
              <p> I also started working on my higher education in 2017 where I attended National University where I
                would
                graudate with a Bachelors Degree in Management. I focused on school very much through 2017 and 2018
                until I was ready to enter the workforce again. End of 2018 I got hired as a Front Desk Associate at Eos
                Fitness in Temecula, CA. 4 months of being there I got promoted to Assistant Operations Manager to
                Operations Manager at a bigger gym location. I excelled and loved every minute of it until March 2020
                where we had the COVID-29 pandemic and I was furloughed.. </p>

              <h2> 2020 - 2022 </h2>
              <p> I knew I had to do something in order to support myself and find a career that wouldn't be put on hold
                when a major circumstance happens. I found myself studying to become an MLO (Mortgage Loan Originator)
                where I found a passion helping veterans and active duty military members use their VA home loan benefit
                to own a home they fought for. I absoultely loved working for Aligned Mortgage until May of 2022 where I
                was laid off due to the down market. I was once again looking for what to do.. </p>

              <h2> 2022 - 2023</h2>
              <p> I discovered what coding really is. I never understand what it was or how it worked, but it's always
                peaked my interest as I was jealous that I couldn't do what software engineer's did. That turned into a
                reality when I joined Learn Acdemy Sept 2022 for a 4 month coding bootcamp where we learned JavaScript,
                HTML, CSS, React, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Postrgresql, Git, and GithHub. Jan 13th is my expected date and I
                look forward to what the future holds. </p>
